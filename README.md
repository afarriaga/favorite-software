Favorite Mac OS X Software
==========================

This is a slightly-opinionated personal favorite list of software for Mac OS X. In the future this may include other resources (not just Mac software), but will always be tailored to developers and power users.

---

> I've included the short snippets to install most of these using Homebrew. The installation instructions for Homebrew and Homebrew Cask are also included. If you would prefer not to use either, you can click on the titles for their respective project pages.
